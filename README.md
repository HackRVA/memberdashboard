# Member Dashboard

## Introduction

Member Dashboard is the source of truth for who has access to what at the makerspace.  
Membership statuses will be pulled down from Payment Providers on a daily basis.  
If a member has made a payment in the past 30 days, they will be considered an active member.

## High level

- The server pulls payment information from paypal (and stores in the db) so we can tell who is currently an active member
- the server will maintain access lists and periodically push those access lists to the microcontrollers on the network
- The microcontroller (aka a resource) stores its access list locally so it's not dependant on the network when someone wants to access the space

# Dev Setup

## The Easy Way (using Remote-Containers)

Install the following

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
- VS Code [Remote-Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

That's it! Nothing else needs to be installed.

If you are on Windows, then it is recommended to clone to the repo to a folder on the WSL for best performance.

Either open the folder in VS Code and choose reopen in container or run the Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container... command and select the local folder.

The backend server can be started by debugging in VS Code. Otherwise, you can start the server without debugging using `sh buildandrun.sh`.

Start the web app as described in the [UI README](/ui/README.md).

```
# navigate to ui folder
cd ui

# install node modules
$ npm ci

# run local env
$ npm run start
```

If you feel cramped in the VS Code terminal pane, you can still connect to dev container shell from your favorite terminal using

```
docker exec -it -u vscode memberdashboard_dev_1 bash
```

Now, go write code and implement features!

### Seed the DB with test data

Create a membership database and grant rights to user test

```
cd test/postgres
sh seedLocal.sh
```

### How to install golang-migrate

```
go install github.com/golang-migrate/migrate/v4/cmd/migrate
```

### CONFIG file

This app requires a config file.
The path for the config file is set using the `MEMBER_SERVER_CONFIG_FILE` environment variable.

the `sample.config.json` can be used as a template for this file.

```
export MEMBER_SERVER_CONFIG_FILE="/etc/hackrva/config.json"
```

## Development Tasks

### Database Migrations

Database migrations are managed using [golang-migrate/migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate). The CLI is already available when using Remote-Containers, otherwise it will need to be installed.

### How to add a migration

A migration can be added by creating an up and down migration file in the migrations folder. The migration file names should be named according to {sequentialNumber}_{description}.up.sql and {sequentialNumber}_{description}.down.sql. Migrations can be created with the following command.

```
make migration name=<NAME>
```

Populate the up and down scripts. Up scripts should be idempotent. Down scripts should revert all changes made by up script

### How to run a migration

Migrations can be applied using the CLI

```
make migrate-up
```

### Generating Swagger Docs

When using Remote-Containers, swagger documentation can be updated using.

```
make swagger
```

Otherwise, follow instructions in [./docs/README.md](./docs/README.md) to install swagger first.

### Querying Postgres

The following options are available if using Remote-Containers.

- Use the [PostgreSQL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ckolkman.vscode-postgres) in VS Code
- Use pgAdmin on [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) with info@hackrva.org/test
- Use make run-sql or make run-sql-command
