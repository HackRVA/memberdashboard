Note that this device stores access information locally in flash.
If for some reason, it does not have network connection, the device will still operate.  However, it will not receive updates.

It's important to occasionally check that the device is connected.  One easy way to do this is in the member dashboard ui on the resources tab.

The device tells us that it's online at some interval.  If it loses connection (or if the server just started), the dashboard will know that it's offline.
